# bootc-installer bundle — the flatpak that also carries the fisherman binary
# the live session installs with (configure-live-krytis.sh symlinks it out of
# the app dir).
#
# INSTALLER_CHANNEL controls which release to pull from:
#   stable (default) → GitHub "latest" release (non-pre-release)
#   dev              → latest-dev rolling pre-release (tracks dev branch)
#
# Source is tuna-os/bootc-installer. Development moved back to the tuna-os org:
# projectbluefin/bootc-installer (this script's previous primary) and
# tuna-os/tuna-installer (its fallback) are both ARCHIVED, last stable releases
# 2026-08-01 and 2026-05-08. That staleness is not cosmetic — it is why krytis
# still shipped the unbootable encrypted-sealed install after the upstream fix
# landed. tuna-os/fisherman#219 (merged 2026-09-19, released v0.4.0) types the
# root partition with the discoverable DPS GUID at partition-creation time, so
# a UKI's gpt-auto-generator can find an encrypted root; the archived flatpak
# predates it. Verified by extracting both bundles: the archived binary carries
# only the old literal `type=linux, name="root"`, the tuna-os one carries the
# arch-aware `type=%s, name="root"`. See docs/skills/secure-boot.md
# § The encrypted-root GUID fix, and where it actually comes from.
#
# There is deliberately no fallback repo. Both former fallbacks are archived,
# and silently installing a months-old bundle reintroduces the very bug this
# source change fixes — a hard failure here is the correct outcome.
