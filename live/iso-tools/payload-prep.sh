#!/usr/bin/bash
# payload-prep.sh — inject bootc install defaults into the payload image and
# emit it as an oci-archive for embedding into the live squashfs store.
#
# Extracted from iso-sd-boot.sh so the identical logic runs either:
#   • directly on the host (host buildah), or
#   • inside the iso-tools container (ISO_TOOLS_IMAGE set) for hosts that
#     lack buildah — invoked via a single `podman run` so the buildah working
#     container persists across the from→copy→commit sequence (ephemeral
#     `podman run` per command would lose it).
#
# All inputs arrive via environment:
#   PAYLOAD_IMAGE      — image ref/tag (names the image inside the oci-archives)
#   PAYLOAD_INPUT      — input oci-archive of the payload image (exported on the
#                        host with `podman save`, so this step needs no access
#                        to the host containers-storage — works rootless+rootful)
#   PAYLOAD_OCI        — output oci-archive path
#   OUTPUT_DIR         — scratch dir for the generated config files
#   COMPOSEFS_BACKEND  — "true" (squash + diffid relabel) or anything else
#   PAYLOAD_SEALED     — "1" to pass the payload through byte-identically
#                        (see the rationale at the pass-through branch below)

# A sealed payload carries a UKI whose .cmdline has a composefs= digest baked in
# at seal time. `bootc install` recomputes that digest over the image it installs
# and refuses a mismatch ("The UKI has the wrong composefs= parameter"). EVERY
# mutation below would invalidate it: the two injected files (00-defaults.toml,
# /etc/containers/storage.conf), and the `buildah run`/`commit --squash` round
# trips themselves, which perturb /tmp and /var/tmp mtimes — the exact, and only,
# discrepancy that broke this digest before (krytis
# docs/skills/secure-boot.md § `bootc container ukify` must run in a throwaway stage).
#
# None of the three is needed for a sealed install:
#   • root-mount-spec sets the root= karg; a UKI's cmdline is frozen and bootc
#     omits root= entirely for UKI+composefs installs.
#   • /etc/containers/storage.conf configures the LIVE env's storage, not the
#     payload's; injecting it into the payload only leaks vfs onto the installed
#     system.
#   • ostree.final-diffid is a config label (digest-neutral), but the buildah
#     round trip that applies it is not.
# Squashing is likewise unnecessary: a sealed image is already single-layer
# (krytis builds it with --squash-all).
